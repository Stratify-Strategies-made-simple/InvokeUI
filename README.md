# InvokeThoughts 🚀

Invoke is a lightweight interface for capturing, refining, and organizing thoughts designed for agentic systems.

Built with React and Node, it provides an intuitive playground for experimenting with prompts, structuring ideas, and preparing high-quality inputs for AI workflows.

## Why Invoke? 🧠

Modern AI systems are only as powerful as the instructions they receive.

InvokeThoughts helps you:

- Capture structured thoughts before sending them to agents

- Experiment with prompt variations in a clean UI

- Organize reusable prompt templates

- Iterate quickly without context switching

- It bridges the gap between raw ideas and production-ready prompts.

## Who Is This For? 🎯

- AI engineers building agent systems

- Researchers iterating on prompt strategies

- Hackathon teams prototyping AI products

- Builders who want structured thinking before automation

## What’s in It for You?

- Explore a curated range of structured prompts designed to spark better thinking and more effective agent interactions.

- Experiment, refine, and discover what truly resonates with you — and help us understand what makes you feel invoked.

- Your feedback shapes the evolution of smarter, more intuitive AI workflows.

## Environment variables

This project uses Vite for the frontend. Client-side environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Firebase credentials.
- Do NOT commit `.env.local` to your repository. `.gitignore` already ignores `.env.local` and `.env` files.

Required variables (in `.env.local`):

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:...:web:...
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-...
